# AI and Data Visualisation Integrated CA

## Project Overview
This project involves solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) for an AI-based logistics company. The tasks include analysing hiring scenarios, comparing CSP solutions with other algorithms, and visualizing the results.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1
Ciara, the founder, knows Python and can only hire four additional employees. The goal is to fulfill the roles of:
- 2 Python Programmers
- 1 AI Engineer
- 1 Web Designer

### Scenario 2
Ciara and Juan partner, allowing for five hires. This includes:
- 3 Python Programmers
- 3 AI Engineers
- 1 Web Designer
- 1 Systems Engineer
- 1 Security Employee (Optional) 

## Methodology
- **CSP Framework**: Includes variables (roles), value domains (candidates), and constraints (skills and role limits).
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Explored alternative algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*) and demonstrated the efficiency of CSP for this problem.
- **Implementation**: Code developed in Python using libraries like `python-constraint`.

## How to Run
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`AlessandraCaballero_AI_DV_ICA.ipynb`).
- Follow the step-by-step explanation for CSP solutions for both scenarios.
- Review the visualisations and comparisons.

## Files in this Repository
- **AlessandraCaballero_AI_DV_ICA.ipynb**: Main notebook containing the CSP implementation, comparisons, and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Project description and overview.
- **AlessandraCaballero_AI_DV _ICA.docx**: Detailed analysis and report (if applicable).
